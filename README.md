Analog Clock
This project features a simple and interactive Analog Clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a real-time working clock with hour, minute, and second hands, each with smooth transitions and realistic visual effects. The clock is fully responsive and designed to adapt to different screen sizes, making it accessible across devices.

Features:
Real-time clock with moving hands (Hour, Minute, Second).
Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (using media queries).
CSS animations for smooth transitions of the clock hands.
Stylish rounded clock face with custom shadows and background color.
Interactive design with clear, visible indicators for each hour (1 to 12).
Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with no external libraries.

How It Works:
The clock face is created using HTML and styled with CSS to give it a circular shape, and the center point is marked with a small circle.
The hands of the clock (hour, minute, and second) are represented by div elements that are rotated based on the current time using JavaScript.
Each hand's rotation is animated to give the appearance of a smooth, ticking clock.
The clock dynamically updates every second, ensuring real-time accuracy.

Usage:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in any modern browser to see the live clock.
Optionally, you can deploy the project on platforms like GitHub Pages for live updates.

Technologies Used:
HTML for structure and content.
CSS for styling and animations.
JavaScript for real-time functionality and clock hand rotation.
